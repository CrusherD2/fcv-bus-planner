# AGENTS.md

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- **Repository state (as of Feb 2026):** The previous project files (`index.html`, `README.md`) are from a scrapped project and are not relevant. The repository currently has no active application, build system, dependencies, or tests.
- **No dependency management:** There is no `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Makefile`, or any other dependency manifest. When a new project is added, update the VM environment script accordingly.
- **No lint/test/build commands exist yet.** Future agents should check for newly added tooling before attempting to run lint, test, or build commands.
